#EasyADC

##Introduction

This is a brief documentation about EasyADC. But what's is it? 

Just like its name, it is a easy-to-use ADC converter using AVR(basically just plug and play). It is a small device with a ATmega8 on board and can do several things at the same time. If you want to see it in action, please visit my project Website ([k-pan.com](k-pan.com))

This device provides various functions:

1. Read/Test Analog Sensors with- or without a external Terminal. You can either read the value with the on-board LCD 16x2 Display or grab the information from the USB serial port.
2. It comes with an onboard PWM generator too. You can use it as a signal source.

####Specifications:
Connections:
	- 5 x 3.3V 
	- 5 x 5V 
	- 5 x GND 
	- 5 x Analog input port (for ADC)
	- 1 x 5k potentiometer (to adjust PWM signal, but you can also read on lcd or usb)
 	- 1 x PWM output
